# autodoc
The script `autodoc-gen.sh`  is designed to automatically generate documentation for your packages using the Sphinx documentation generator.

# How is this helpful?
One of the main advantages of using `autodoc` in conjunction with `Sphinx` is that it automatically generates ReStructured Text (.rst) files in a folder-wise manner. This means that the generated .rst files are organized in a structured folder hierarchy, which can greatly simplify the documentation website with each module having its toctree.

Another advantage of using `autodoc` is that it automatically removes unwanted headings and text such as Submodules, Subpackages, module, package and etc. Additionally `autodoc` displays the names of modules, submodules, and functions in a concise and readable format. For instance, when documenting a function like `solve` from the `solver.py` module within the `neuro` package, `Sphinx` would display it as `neuro.solver.solve`, whereas `autodoc` would only show `solve`. This reduction of unnecessary clutter helps improve the overall readability and aesthetics of the documentation.

# Can't we achieve this by just using Sphinx?
Yes, we can do it with Sphinx but we need to modify each .rst file generated by Sphinx. This process is time-consuming and tedious, often taking hours or even days to modify each .rst file individually for large packages. Consequently, investing such a substantial amount of time in manual editing becomes inefficient and can be seen as a waste of valuable resources.

# How to create documetation sites using `autodoc`?
Step 1:
Create `docs` directory inside the project folder where the source code is located.
